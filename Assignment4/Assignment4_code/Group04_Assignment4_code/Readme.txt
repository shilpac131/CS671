Primarily three architectures are chosen for this assignment:
Arch 1: 64-32-64 (3 hidden layers)
Arch 2: 512-128-64 (3 hidden layers)
Arch 3: 512-512-256-256-256 (5 hidden layers)

Task 1: Separate folder for this task is present. Each file has naming convention Task1_PCA{reduced_dim}. Each .py file contains all the 3 architectures choosen.
Task 2: Separate folder for this task is present. Each file has naming convention Task2_{bottleneck_layer_neurons}. Each .py file contains both one hidden layer and 3 hidden layer architectures.
Task 3 and Task 4: Separate folder for these task is present merged named Task3n4. Each file has naming convention Task3n4_{bottleneck_layer_neurons}_Arch2. We have only presented the best architecture that is Arch 2.
Task 5: Separate .py file is present. This single .py file contains entire task 5.
Task 6: Separate .py file is present. This single .py file contains entire task 6.
